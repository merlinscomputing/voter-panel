        RSS:

The following commands can be executed at the RSS: prompt:

Station ID
GET BPN
      This command returns the 48-bit station ID.
      The number is displayed in hexidecimal.  The number is necessary
      to obtain firmware upgrades for Flash capable Quantars.
      Response: BPN = xxxxxxxxxxxx
        The serial number is also required to order firmware upgrades.
        See GET STN SN.

Serial Number
GET STN SN
      This command requests the Station's Serial Number.
      Response: STN SN = <station_serial_number>

Firmware Versions
GET FW_VER [SC.O | WL.O | BOOT.O | BOOT2.O ] (the *.O) is the letter "o" not Zero!
      This command will retrieve the current firmware version and
timestamp
      of the specified object file.

EXAMPLES: Paste these to the "host" then press "enter"

GET FW_VER SC.O
GET FW_VER WL.O
GET FW_VER BOOT.O
GET FW_VER BOOT2.O

      Response: FW_VER = xxxx.xx.xxx TIMESTAMP = yyyy/mm/dd hh:nn
       The timestamp is when the code was programmed ("flashed").
       The format of the timestamp value is:
                yyyy = year (range 0000 - 9999)
                mm = month (range 01 - 12)
                dd = day (range 01 - 31)
                hh = hours (range 00 - 23)

      Introduced in Release: R09.00.00

Firmware Version (Non-Flash Capable Quantars)
GET FW_VER [ SC | WL | EX ]
      This command returns the firmware version of the Station Control
      board.  Format is "Xddd.dd.ddd", where "ddd.dd.ddd" represents
      the "system", "major", and "minor" version numbers (SC, WL, and
      EX should have the same system version to be compatible).
      Response: FW_VER [ SC | WL | EX ] = Rnnn.nn.nnn
      Introduced in Release: 1

IP Address
GET ADDR IP
      This command retrieves the Station's IP Address located in the  EEPROM
      Network partition.

          where `x' is a numeric digit, range:0-9
      Introduced in Release: R09.00.00

Date
SET DATE YYYY/MM/DD
      This command sets the current date (as tracked by the operating
      system) to the new date given.
      Response: None

Time
SET TIME HH:MM[:SS]
      This command sets the current time (as tracked by the operating
      system) to the given value. Seconds are optional and defaulted to
      zero.
      Response: None

Alarms
ALARM CLEAR
      This command requests that all alarms be cleared from the Alarm Log.
      Response: None
ALARM RD value
      This command requests that the Station send the alarm log entry for
      the specified alarm number, 'value'.
      Responses:
      ALARM = YYYY/MM/DD.HH:MM:SS YYYY/MM/DD.HH:MM:SS X SC daignostic_msg
